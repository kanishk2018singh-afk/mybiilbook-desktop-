# MyBillBook Desktop Companion — V1 foundation

A secure Electron + React + TypeScript desktop companion for the Android Showroom Management app. This first module implements:

- Firebase Web SDK initialisation
- Firebase Authentication with **Google Sign-In**
- Reading all business documents from `users/{uid}/businesses`
- A business picker when a user owns more than one showroom
- `BusinessContext`, which stores the active `businessId`
- A reusable `getBusinessPath(uid, businessId, collectionName)` helper for every subsequent Firestore query
- Electron security defaults (`contextIsolation`, no Node integration, narrow preload bridge)

It deliberately contains **no Firestore write methods**. V1 remains read-only.

## Run locally

```bash
cd desktop
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in the Firebase Web app config for the Android app's existing Firebase project.
npm install
npm run dev
```

To type-check and create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run dist
```

## Firebase configuration

1. Open the **same Firebase project** used by the Android app.
2. In **Project settings → Your apps**, add or select a **Web app**. Do not copy the Android app ID into this project.
3. Copy the Web app's `firebaseConfig` fields to `desktop/.env`.
4. In **Authentication → Sign-in method**, enable **Google**.
5. In **Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains**, add `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` for local/Electron development. The packaged desktop app serves its renderer over a loopback HTTP origin because Firebase's browser Auth SDK does not support `file://` OAuth.
6. Ensure Firestore rules allow the signed-in user to read their own data.

Example development rule shape:

```firestore
match /users/{uid}/businesses/{businessId}/{document=**} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
}
```

Do not change the shared rule to `allow write: if false` solely for desktop: that would also prevent the Android app from writing. The desktop code has no mutation APIs in V1.

## Data flow

```text
Google Sign-In
  → Firebase Auth User (uid)
  → onSnapshot(users/{uid}/businesses)
  → BusinessContext.selectedBusinessId
  → getBusinessPath(uid, businessId, 'salesInvoices')
  → all dashboard/module subscriptions
```

## Key files

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/lib/firebase.ts` | Firebase Web SDK initialisation from environment variables |
| `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` | Auth session and Google Sign-In |
| `src/context/BusinessContext.tsx` | Business list and selected `businessId` |
| `src/lib/firestorePaths.ts` | Scoped, validated Firestore path helpers |
| `src/repositories/businessRepository.ts` | Real-time business subscription |
| `electron/main.ts` | Secure Electron window and loopback renderer host |

## Next module

Build read-only repositories using the selected scope, for example:

```ts
const path = getBusinessPath(uid, businessId, 'salesInvoices')
// users/{uid}/businesses/{businessId}/salesInvoices
```

Use `onSnapshot()` for dashboard data and unsubscribe when the selected business changes.
